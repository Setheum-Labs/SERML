# SERML
Substrate Ecosystem Runtime Module Library (SERML) ðŸš€
Serml is a community based library/collection of Substrate Blockchain Development Runtime Modules maintained by Setheum Labs for Subatrate based Blockchain projects like Setheum, Polkadot, Kusama, et al.

## Runtime Modules Overview

- [price](./price)
	- Implements a simple price feed.
- [serp-market](./serp-market)
    - Implements a Multicurrency Elastic Stablecoin Auction Market that buys or auctions the Reserve Asset/ Native Currency for multiple stable-currencies/stablecoins that will be contracted or expanded by the `serp-tes` pallet. Developed originally for the SERP (Setheum Elastic Reserve Protocol) as SERP pallets.
- [serp-tes](./serp-tes)
	- Implements a Multicurrency Elastic Stablecoin Token Elasticity of Supply (TES) System that Elastically Algorithmically Contracts and Expands stablecoin/stable-currency supply with a native currency as Reserve Asset. Developed originally for the SERP (Setheum Elastic Reserve Protocol) as SERP pallets.
- [storage-adapters](./storage-adapters)
    - Implements of a collection of transient storage adapters on top of the substrate storage API.
- [stp258](./stp258)
    - Implements a Multicurrency Elastic Stablecoin Setheum Tokenization Protocol (STP) that provides multiple stable currencies under one umbrella and a Reserve Asset that Algorithmically through other SERP/SERML pallets stabilizes the stable-currencies. Developed originally for the SERP (Setheum Elastic Reserve Protocol) as SERP pallets.
